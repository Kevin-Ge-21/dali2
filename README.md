# 2nd Code Example
This was a function I built for algorithms to calculate the amount of cube summable numbers between 1 and a target value B. 
A number is cube-summable if it can be expressed as the sum of distinct positive cubes.

Note: if you want me to take this down because it was a coding assignment, just let me know. The instructions did say that I could submit previous course work and that the repos had to be public, so wasn't sure how exactly I should have proceeded.
